## App Store Connect
We integrated App Store Connect into our app to make it easier to publish it to the App Store. With App Store Connect, we were able to easily manage all aspects of the app's distribution on the App Store.

## Expo Application Services (EAS)
To make it easier to deploy a development build to a live iOS device, we used Expo Application Services (EAS) and the EAS-CLI tools. With this, we were able to quickly deploy our development build and test it on a live iOS device.

## Tailwind CSS
To improve the design of our app, we used Tailwind CSS. With Tailwind, we were able to create a modern and responsive design that looks great on all devices.

## Expo Icons
We also used Expo Icons to improve the UI of our app. With Expo Icons, we were able to easily add icons to our app and improve the overall user experience.

## React Native Navigation
Our app's navigation is powered by React Native Navigation. With this, we were able to create a seamless and intuitive navigation experience for our users.

## TypeScript
To reduce the overall number of bugs and errors, we used TypeScript to write our code. With TypeScript, we were able to catch errors before they became a problem and ensure a smoother development process.

## Custom Hook
To extend the functionality of React, we wrote a custom hook. With this hook, we were able to create a more efficient and intuitive development process for our team.
